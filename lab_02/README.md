## Eggs.java Planning (***Before*** writing code)

### Initial Planning - Problem Analysis

What are the requirements of this problem?

* What is already known about the problem?
* What questions do you have about the problem?

*Given:  
Number of eggs ordered (user input)  
Price of a dozen eggs: $3.25  
Price of an individual egg: $0.45  
Required:  
Number of dozens
Number of individual
Total cost of an order.*



What knowledge concepts from pre-lab would help you solve this problem?

*Primitive Data Types, Style Guide, Debugging Methods, System.out.print Method, Arithmetic Operations, etc.*

### Initial Planning - Solution Plan

What algorithms will be needed to address the problem? Describe the algorithms using English statements or sentences. You should not write out Java code yet.

*Pseudocode:  
Create variables: numEggs, numDozens, numIndividuals, dozenPrice, individualPrice, totalPrice  
Create scanner: orderScanner  
Ask for user input: number of eggs  
Calculate number of dozens using "/"  
Calculate number of individuals using "%"  
Output (print to screen) the order details*

## Eggs.java Reflection (***After*** writing code)

How well did your code address the requirements of this exercise?

*My final code addressed the requirements perfectly.*

How did you apply the pre-lab concepts in this exercise?

*I applied almost all of them. There were a few bugs and confusions that came up along the way, but they were resolved at the end.*

What are some new insights that you learned from this exercise?

*Somethings that I didn't knew before this practice:  
Class name must be exactly the same as the file name.  
Some more insight about the Scanner class (ways to initiate instances and utilize its methods)  
More insight about System.out.printf  
How to edit and preview markdown files*

Estimate how much time (minutes) you spent on this exercise.

*Around 90 minutes including time spent on this journal*
