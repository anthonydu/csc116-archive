## Employee List Planning (***Before*** writing code)

### Initial Planning - Problem Analysis

What are the requirements of this problem?

* What is already known about the problem?
* What questions do you have about the problem?

This program is supposed to use an employee's first name, middle initial, and last name to do such name operations.

What knowledge concepts from pre-lab would help you solve this problem?

The knowledge of strings, objects, setters/getters, constructors, and private fields should help solve this problem.

### Initial Planning - Solution Plan

What algorithms will be needed to address the problem? Describe the algorithms using English statements or sentences. You should not write out Java code yet.

We will need to display the name in normal and reverse order by just changing the order of the getter methods that we do in the string return statements. We will need to have the initials by taking all of the first characters (which the middle initial is already) and making them all upper case. We will need to have the unity id by taking the first and middle initials and then check for if the last name is more then 6 characters to make it display only the first 6 characters and then make it all lower case. The length needs to be determined by just counting the characters of the normal order name.

## Employee List Reflection (***After*** writing code)

How well did your code address the requirements of this exercise?

We think our code addressed the requirements of this exercise very well.

How did you apply the pre-lab concepts in this exercise?

The concepts of objects, constructors, privates, setters/getters, and strings helped us in this exercise.

What are some new insights that you learned from this exercise?

A new insight we learned is that the compiler does not like master-looking quotes, it only likes the atom-typed quotes when doing javadoc checkstyling.

Estimate how much time (minutes) you spent on this exercise.

We spent about 40 minutes on this exercise.
