## Triangle Type Planning (***Before*** writing code)

### Initial Planning - Problem Analysis

What are the requirements of this problem?

* What is already known about the problem?
* What questions do you have about the problem?

Given: three side lengths

Determine if it's a valid triangle.

See if it's equilateral, isosceles or scalene.

What knowledge concepts from pre-lab would help you solve this problem?

If else statements, ==, !=, >, >=, <, <=, &&, ||

### Initial Planning - Solution Plan

What algorithms will be needed to address the problem? Describe the algorithms using English statements or sentences. You should not write out Java code yet.

Pseudocode:

Ask for three side lengths

Use an if statement to determine if the triangle is valid

Within that if statement create another if statement that determines if the triangle is equilateral, isosceles or scalene

Output type of triangle

## Triangle Type Reflection (***After*** writing code)

How well did your code address the requirements of this exercise?

It addressed the requirements very well.

How did you apply the pre-lab concepts in this exercise?

We used if statements as well as many of the conditional operators.

What are some new insights that you learned from this exercise?

If statements can contain many requirements.

Estimate how much time (minutes) you spent on this exercise.

60 minutes.
