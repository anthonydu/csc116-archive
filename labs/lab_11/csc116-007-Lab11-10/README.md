# CSC116: Lab 11 Journal - Modifying Arrays

## Character Arrays Planning (***Before*** writing code)

### Initial Planning - Problem Analysis

What are the requirements of this problem?

* What is already known about the problem?
* What questions do you have about the problem?

accept an array of characters (char) and swap the elements at adjacent indexes (for example, elements 0 and 1 are swapped, elements 2 and 3 are swapped, and so on). If the array has an odd length, the final element should be left unmodified.
accept an array of characters (char) and a string then return a new array with the counts for each character array element in the string. The task should be case-sensitive.

What knowledge concepts from pre-lab would help you solve this problem?

arrays modify.

### Initial Planning - Solution Plan

What algorithms will be needed to address the problem? Describe the algorithms using English statements or sentences. You should not write out Java code yet.

let the temporary variable be the first one 
let the first one be the second one 
let the second one be the temporary variable
then use for loop to make everyone change.


## Character Arrays Reflection (***After*** writing code)

How well did your code address the requirements of this exercise? 

Very well. We finished all the bug and it runs perfectly, and there is no checkstyle erro. 

How did you apply the pre-lab concepts in this exercise? 

Set a temporary variable to change the array and use for loop to make all of it change.

What are some new insights that you learned from this exercise? 

When we use for loop, remember to distinguish the different between < and <=. It will make the i start at 0 or 1 different. 

Estimate how much time (minutes) you spent on this exercise.
Around 30mins .
