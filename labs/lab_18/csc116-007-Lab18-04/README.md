## Rational Number Planning (***Before*** writing code)

### Initial Planning - Problem Analysis

What are the requirements of this problem?

* What is already known about the problem?
* What questions do you have about the problem?

This program needs to be able to add, subtract, multiply, divide two rational numbers to find an answer that needs to be simplified.

What knowledge concepts from pre-lab would help you solve this problem?

The knowledge of constructors, custom equals and toString methods, and object parameters/methods should help solve this problem.

### Initial Planning - Solution Plan

What algorithms will be needed to address the problem? Describe the algorithms using English statements or sentences. You should not write out Java code yet.

We will need to make sure the fractions have a common denominator when adding and subtracting, but after adding, subtracting, multiplying, or dividing, the fraction needs to be reduced. This can occur by finding the greatest common factor of the resulting numerator and denominator starring Euclidean's algorithm.

## Rational Number Reflection (***After*** writing code)

How well did your code address the requirements of this exercise?

We think our code addressed the requirements very well in a creative way.

How did you apply the pre-lab concepts in this exercise?

We applied the concepts of constructors and objects as well as private fields in this exercise. We also applied the instanceof usage when making our own equals and toString methods.

What are some new insights that you learned from this exercise?

Some new insights we learned is how to use "other" objects to operate two numbers. We also learned how to find the greatest common factor of two numbers and the least common multiple of two unlike denominators.

Estimate how much time (minutes) you spent on this exercise.

We spent about 110 minutes on this exercise.
