## Race Pace Calculator Planning (***Before*** writing code)

### Initial Planning - Problem Analysis

What are the requirements of this problem?

* What is already known about the problem?
* What questions do you have about the problem?

We are creating a program that asks for a user input of Type of race along with their total time.
Given these inputs, the program should create a pace for how fast they should run each mile.

What knowledge concepts from pre-lab would help you solve this problem?

Using a switch is a key concept that allowed our code to run. Something new to us specifically from prelab.

### Initial Planning - Solution Plan

What algorithms will be needed to address the problem? Describe the algorithms using English statements or sentences. You should not write out Java code yet.

Import Scanner

Create variables for distance and time

Create scanner object

Print the list of distances

Ask user for distance

Ask user for time

Calculate speed

Print result

## Race Pace Calculator Reflection (***After*** writing code)

How well did your code address the requirements of this exercise?

Our code satisfied all System testing

How did you apply the pre-lab concepts in this exercise?

Incorporating a switch instead of if else statements to see which input is being chose for race type

What are some new insights that you learned from this exercise?

In what cases a switch might be used for, and when parse int might have to be used
